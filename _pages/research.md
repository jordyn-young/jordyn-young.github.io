## Social Media Use and Well-Being
In collaboration with Dr. Melissa G Hunt and UPenn undergraduates Rachel Marx, and Courtney Lipson, this study is the first of it's kind to experimentally determine the impact of reduced objective social media use on psychological well-being. After a week of baseline monitoring, 143 undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania were randomly assigned to either limit Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat use to 10 minutes, per platform, per day, or to use social media as usual for three weeks. The limited use group showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression over three weeks compared to the control group. Both groups showed significant decreases in anxiety and fear of missing out over baseline, suggesting a benefit of increased self-monitoring. This work was published in the *Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology* in December 2018 ([PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordyn-Young/publication/328838624_No_More_FOMO_Limiting_Social_Media_Decreases_Loneliness_and_Depression/links/5be5a5cb299bf1124fc63279/No-More-FOMO-Limiting-Social-Media-Decreases-Loneliness-and-Depression.pdf))
