My name is Jordyn Young and I am a PhD student in the [Department of Information Science](https://drexel.edu/cci/academics/information-science-department/) at Drexel University working with [Dr. Andrea Forte](http://andreaforte.net/). Prior to graduate school, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/) where I conducted research with [Dr. Melissa Hunt](https://www.melissahunt.net/).

My research examines the impact of our increasingly digital lives. Using a diverse methodological skillset, I employ both qualitative and quantitative approaches to understand how we can use popular social media sites in a healthier way.

In my spare time, I enjoy working out, baking with my friends, and exploring with my dog, Bumper!
