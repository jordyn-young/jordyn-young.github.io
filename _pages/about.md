My name is Jordyn Young and I am a PhD student at the [University of Michigan's School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Andrea Forte](http://andreaforte.net/) and [Dr. Nicole Ellison](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/nicole-ellison). Prior to graduate school, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/) where I worked with [Dr. Melissa Hunt](https://www.melissahunt.net/). My research examines the impact of our increasingly digital lives. I'm particularly interested in human-computer interaction, social computing, and computational social science.
