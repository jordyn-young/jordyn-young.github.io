My name is Jordyn Young and I am a PhD student in [Information Science](https://drexel.edu/cci/academics/information-science-department/) at Drexel University. I am advised by [Dr. Andrea Forte](http://andreaforte.net/) in the Social Computing Research Group. Prior to graduate school, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/) where I worked with [Dr. Melissa Hunt](https://www.melissahunt.net/). My research examines the impact of our increasingly digital lives.
